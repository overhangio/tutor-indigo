- 💥[Feature] Use upstream provided way of switching between light & dark theme variants. (by @Faraz32123, @arbirali)
    - Use `indigo-2.5.0` brand version which separates the dark & light theme variants instead of using 1 theme & a class based styling on body to toggle between themes. Note: we have used design tokens for both light and dark theme variants.
    - On Upstream, theme variants are set on page load using a `selected-paragon-theme-variant` value from localStorage.
